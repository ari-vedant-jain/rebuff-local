# rebuff-local
This repository is a fork of the original Rebuff from Prompt.ai, which enhances the ability to protect AI applications from prompt injection attacks. Rebuff provides a multi-layered defense mechanism by using heuristics, vector-based similarity detection, and language model checks to validate whether a user input is malicious.
