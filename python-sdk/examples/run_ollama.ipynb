    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we explore using **Ollama** for embedding generation and **ChromaDB** or **Pinecone** for vector storage, while detecting potential prompt injections. Prompt injection attacks can trick a system into ignoring previous instructions or executing unintended actions. The goal here is to develop a defense mechanism using vector search to detect such injections.\n",
    "The following libraries are used:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ollama** for generating embeddings locally from user inputs.\n",
    "- **ChromaDB** for local vector storage\n",
    "- **Pinecone** for cloud-based vector storage and searching.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Installing the required dependencies.\n",
    "2. DB for Vector Storage: We are using ChromaDB as the local vector storage solution for embedding comparison and Pinecone for Cloud-based Solution.\n",
    "3. Ollama Model for Embeddings: Ollama is used to generate embeddings from the input strings for vector similarity search.\n",
    "4. Prompt Injection Detection: The detect_injection method checks whether the input string contains a potential prompt injection attack.\n",
    "5. Canary Word Mechanism: A canary word is added to the prompt to detect if any sensitive information leaks during AI-generated responses."
